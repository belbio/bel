  NOTE: This schema is NOT an official Nanopub JSON Schema by the
  [Nanopub Organization](http://nanopub.org/). It is conceptually derived
  from their fine work for the needs of [BEL.bio](http://bel.bio).

  The purpose of this schema is to manage assertions (labeled as edges in
  the schema) and associated metadata such as assertion citation, context and
  general metadata.  This format is designed for use with [BEL](http://bel.bio).
  It differs from the nanopub_graphdati schema due to a stricter specification
  of the nanopub context object.

  Please provide feedback as github issues or pull requests at
  https://github.com/belbio/schemas.

  The master version of this JSON Schema is managed at:
  https://github.com/belbio/schemas/blob/master/schemas/nanopub_bel-0.9.0.yaml

  A nanopub file is either a single nanopub, an array of nanopubs or uses
  the JSON Lines (http://jsonlines.org/) format with a nanopub (or schema_uri,
  metadata object) per line.

  Note: This JSON schema is designed to work with the Swagger Specification as a
  schema object which does not allow 'type' to be an array so not able to specify
  optional elements as "type": ["string", "null"] for example.

  Nanopubs can be stored as either individual JSON files with a single optional
  metadata JSON file OR as collection using an array of JSON Nanopubs or a JSONLines
  version where each line is a nanopub JSON object.  In an array or JSONLines
  version, the metadata and schema_uri objects need to be at the top.

  Obviously some combinations of the following objects in the anyOf below
  are not compatible.  It doesn't make sense to use the nanopub object and
  array of nanopub objects at the same time.
