                "abstract": "Recently, we identified the two myeloid related protein-8 (MRP8) (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9) as fatty acid-binding proteins (Klempt, M., Melkonyan, H., Nacken, W., Wiesmann, D., Holtkemper, U., and Sorg, C. (1997) FEBS Lett. 408, 81-84). Here we present data that the S100A8/A9 protein complex represents the exclusive arachidonic acid-binding proteins in human neutrophils. Binding and competition studies revealed evidence that (i) fatty acid binding was dependent on the calcium concentration; (ii) fatty acid binding was specific for the protein complex formed by S100A8 and S100A9, whereas the individual components were unable to bind fatty acids; (iii) exclusively polyunsaturated fatty acids were bound by S100A8/A9, whereas saturated (palmitic acid, stearic acid) and monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid) as well as arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids (15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, prostaglandin E(2), thromboxane B(2), leukotriene B(4)) were poor competitors. Stimulation of neutrophil-like HL-60 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to the secretion of S100A8/A9 protein complex, which carried the released arachidonic acid. When elevation of intracellular calcium level was induced by A23187, release of arachidonic acid occurred without secretion of S100A8/A9. In view of the unusual abundance in neutrophilic cytosol (approximately 40% of cytosolic protein) our findings assign an important role for S100A8/A9 as mediator between calcium signaling and arachidonic acid effects. Further investigations have to explore the exact function of the S100A8/A9-arachidonic acid complex both inside and outside of neutrophils.",
